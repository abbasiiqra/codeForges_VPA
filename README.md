Virtual Personal Assistant
In this project I have created a personal virtual assistant which can do various task for me such as searching web, scheduling events in google calendar operated by voice.
Problem statement:
Develop a user-friendly interface for rebel commanders to seamlessly interact with the Virtual Personal Assistant (VPA), accommodating both text and voice inputs.

Implement streamlined techniques for analyzing user-input commands, enhancing the VPA' s understanding and responsiveness to commander instructions.

Create a robust algorithm for task management, allowing commanders to efficiently schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments, adapting to the unpredictable nature of warfare.

Ensure a secure data backup systemto store all user preferences, schedules, and personal information in a protected database,facilitating data retrieval at any time.

Design an intuitive interface guiding rebel commanders through scheduling and time management processes, prioritizing simplicity and clarity.

Action performed are:                                                                                                                                                 1.Voice recognition                                                                                                                                                  2.Web search by inputing voice as instruction                                                                                                                        3.Scheduling an event  on google calendar by taking inputs from users

tech stacks:
I have use python as the basic language to build the model.
I have used  pyttsx3 library for text to speech conversion

I have used speech_recognition library to capture the inputed voice.

I have used selenium library to connect the model with web/chrome.

I have used tkinter library for graphic user interface

I have used Google-auth to authenticate to Google calendar API.

WHAT DOES THE PROJECT DELIVERS?

THE PROJECT OFFERS A PERSONAL VOICE ASSISTANT WHO CAN PERFORM SEVERAL ACTIONS BY LISTENING THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY THE USER.
THE MODEL CAN SEARCH ANY THING ON  THE WEB/ CHROME AS INSTRUCTED BY USER.
THE MODEL CAN SCHEDULE THE EVENT ON GOOGLE CALENDAR BY TAKING INPUT DETAILS ABOUT THE EVENT FROM THE USER.
AN INTERACTIVE GUI IS ALSO THERE FOR SMOOTH USER INTERFACE.
